## Supported Versions

This repository is a dataset and documentation project. We track technology failures. While "versions" don't apply in the traditional software sense, we are committed to maintaining the integrity of the data.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2026.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| 2025.x  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is a static dataset, "vulnerabilities" usually mean:
- **Malicious Links**: An external link in our sources has been taken over by malware.
- **Privacy Leak**: An entry inadvertently exposes PII (Personally Identifiable Information) that was not already public in the source material.
- **XSS/Injection**: A payload in a failure entry that executes when viewed in certain renderers.

### How to Report
Please do not open a public GitHub issue for privacy leaks or active malicious vectors.

Email the maintainers directly or open a draft restricted Security Advisory in this repository if enabled.

We will review the report within 72 hours.

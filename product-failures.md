# Product & Strategy Failures 🧪

Good engineering, wrong product. Solid execution, wrong market.
When the product was built but nobody wanted it.

## Premature Launches

### (2014) Google Glass — Technology Ahead of Society

```yaml
---
type: product
cause: timing
stage: growth
impact: trust
tags: [premature, privacy, fashion, user-acceptance, enterprise-pivot]
---

**What happened:** Google launched Glass as a consumer product in 2014 for $1,500. Pulled from market in 2015. Eventually pivoted to enterprise, then discontinued entirely in 2023.

**Impact:** $1,500 device with no practical use case; privacy backlash ("Glassholes"); never achieved mainstream adoption; reputation damage for Google hardware.

**Root cause:** Technology was 5-10 years ahead of social acceptance; no killer app justified the form factor; privacy concerns made people uncomfortable; $1,500 price point with no clear value; marketing couldn't manufacture "cool."

**Lessons:**
- Technology readiness ≠ market readiness
- Social acceptance is as important as technical readiness
- Privacy concerns are product risks, not edge cases
- "Cool" can't be bought through influencer marketing

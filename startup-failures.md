## PMF Failures

### (2020) Quibi — $1.75B Burn in 6 Months

```yaml
---
type: startup
cause: no-pmf
stage: growth
impact: money
tags: [timing, market-context, halo-effect, wrong-assumptions, content-strategy]
---

**What happened:** Quibi raised $1.75B to build "Netflix for your phone" with 10-minute premium content. Launched April 2020, shut down October 2020. Burned through nearly $2B in under 7 months.

**Impact:** All investor capital lost; 500+ employees laid off; became case study in timing, PMF, and overconfidence. Content library sold for scraps.

**Root cause:** Wrong market assumptions (on-the-go viewing irrelevant during COVID); content didn't justify subscription; timing destroyed core use case; too much faith in "dream team" rather than product-market fit.

**Lessons:**
- Market timing isn't adjustable. If your use case becomes irrelevant, you're stuck.
- "Dream team" doesn't substitute for product-market fit
- Content differentiation must be obvious, not explained
- Validate assumptions with minimal spend before scaling

Failures not caused by code, but by how decisions were made.
Incentive misalignment, ownership gaps, and the quiet killers of organizations.

## Innovator's Dilemma

### (1975-2012) Kodak — Invented Digital, Buried It

```yaml

type: decision
cause: incentives
stage: scale
impact: money
tags: [innovators-dilemma, fear-of-cannibalization, short-term-incentives, missed-opportunity]

**What happened:** Kodak engineer Steve Sasson invented the digital camera in 1975. Kodak filed the patent and buried it for 20+ years, afraid it would destroy their film business. Filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

**Impact:** From 90% film market share to bankruptcy; $28B market cap to zero; 140,000 employees to a fraction; the company that invented digital photography lost to companies that didn't invent it.

**Root cause:** Leadership incentives tied to short-term film profits; fear of cannibalization; no ownership of digital transition; "innovator's dilemma" in pure form—success blinded them to disruption.

**Lessons:**
- Incentives that reward defending the past will destroy the future
- Cannibalization fear without action just delays the inevitable
- Innovation requires ownership and metrics separate from legacy business
- Market disruption doesn't wait for comfortable transitions

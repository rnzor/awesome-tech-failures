# Awesome Tech Failures 💥

Failure is data.

A curated, tagged library of real-world tech failures — outages, breaches, startup shutdowns, product flops, **AI slop**, and automation disasters.

**Goal:** learn faster by studying what broke, why it broke, and what actually fixed it.

> Success stories sell. Failure stories teach.

## How this repo works

Each entry has:
- **What happened** (1–2 lines)
- **Impact** (who/what got hit)
- **Root cause** (best-known)
- **Lessons** (actionable)
- **Tags** (so humans & AI agents can search patterns)

If you ship AI agents or automation: start with **AI Slop & Automation**.
